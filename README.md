# üê∂üê± Dog vs Cat Image Classification using CNN (TensorFlow)
This project is a deep learning-based image classification model that categorizes images into two classes: Dog and Cat using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow.
This is a Basic for image Classification for bginner,for complex use case there are many steps to follow to preprocess and train Model.
 
### üìå Features
* Built using TensorFlow and Keras.
* Uses CNN for feature extraction and classification.
* Trained on a dataset of labeled images of dogs and cats.
* Data augmentation for better generalization.
* Achieves high accuracy in classifying images.

### Steps 
1. Installation of require library <br />
    ```pip install tensorflow os numpy matplotlib ```

2. Load Dataset
3. Scale your Data
4. Split for training and testing
5. Build a Deep Learning Model <br />
    *Model Architecture <br />
       -Convolutional Layers for feature extraction <br />
       -Max Pooling for dimensionality reduction <br />
       -Fully Connected (Dense) Layers for classification <br />
6. Train Model <br/>
